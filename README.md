# Playlist Bot

### Discover Weekly Bot:

> In the works.

> This bot is designed to save my 'Discover Weekly' playlists on spotify to a personal playlist on a weekly basis. This way, I will always have a personalized playlist dedicated to discovering new music.

### Sorting Bot:

> In the works

> This bot is designed to sort my liked library on Spotify into playlists based on each songs genre(s) on a monthly basis. This will allow for a manageable 'liked library' playlist as it 'resets' every month, and easy access to the songs I have 'liked' on Spotify according to genre. This will come in particularly handy when trying to create playlists based on a certain feel/theme.
